# 🏢 Employee Management System
The Employee Management System is a Frontend web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React Framework, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS. It includes dedicated dashboards for both admins and employees, enabling seamless task management and communication. The application uses local storage to persist user and task data, making it lightweight and easy to set up without requiring an external database.<br>

Admins can create tasks, assign them to employees, and monitor their progress. Employees can view their tasks, update their statuses, and interact with assignments through an intuitive and responsive interface.<br>
